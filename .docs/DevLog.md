<h1 align="center">The Synaxis Server Dev Log</h1>

A simple log of all the work done on the Synaxis Server repo by date.

## January 2022

### January 24, 2022 - Monday

A little past midnight I was inspired to start this project from scratch again when I tried to continue my work from the previous repo and found that I didn't exactly know what I was last working on.
I'm hoping that this attempt will be my last to get this off the ground.
And I'm hoping that this development log will help me with consistency.

Today, I started the project.
A simple `npm init` and `git init` followed by installing my favorite packages: express and dotenv (because duh) and nodemon and commitizen for development.
I am a huge fan of commitizen.
Simple but powerful explanatory commit messages go a long way towards understanding a project.

After this, I added a few markdown files like this log.
Tomorrow, the real work begins.
I'm hoping to build this server using Test Driven Development.
And although I'm still new to it, I'd like to use Typescript as well in order to ensure that there aren't any silly bugs.
